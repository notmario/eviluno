      This is a game based on the card game UNO. If you are not familiar with the rules of UNO, this is not the place for you.

      The objective of the game is to have no cards in your hand. You win the game when this occurs. If multiple players have no cards in hand, then they do not win and the game continues. The deck contains 440 cards at present in 8 colours (red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and magenta), with varying effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player who last won a game of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campaign_for_North_Africa">The Campaign for North Africa</a></em> goes first. <br> In the unlikely event that nobody has completed a game of <em>The Campaign for North Africa</em>, a different method may be used to determine the starting player.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deal out a seven card hand to each player and flip over the top two cards of the deck to form two <b>play piles</b>. There is also a <b>discard pile</b> which starts empty, and will be filled by card effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      On your turn, you may play one card to a play pile, or draw a card. You must draw a card if you cannot play. You can play cards if they match the top card of the chosen play pile by <b>colour</b> or <b>number</b>, or if the played card is <b>wild</b>. <br> When you have only one card left in hand, you must call out "UNO", or any other word agreed upon by all players before the game. If you do not call it before someone else does, then you must draw two cards. <br> If you draw a card that is a valid playable card, you may play it. If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle all cards in the discard and play piles (not including the top card of each) to form the new deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you draw a <b>MOD</b> card, you must immediately reveal it to all players, and then you must choose to either <b>ACCEPT</b> or <b>DECLINE</b> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ACCEPT</b>: Draw four cards and put the <b>MOD</b> card in play in front of you. <br>
      <b>DECLINE</b>: Discard the <b>MOD</b> card and draw a replacement card.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have at most two <b>MOD</b> cards in front of you. If you would have more, choose <b>MOD</b> cards to discard until you have at most two.
    </p>

      Below is a list of all unique card types in the game, ignoring colour. <br>
      All <b>wild</b> cards can be played at any time on any pile. When played, choose a valid colour. The card's colour becomes the chosen colour. <br>
      When a card tells a player to draw cards (i.e. "the next player draws two cards"), their next turn is skipped if they are the next player, unless otherwise specified.
